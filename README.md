Concentration Game

A set of cards will be shown face down. Each card has an image.
The main goal is to find another card with the same image (aka A Match).
You can flip two cards for each turn.
If the cards match, you will earn points!
If they don't match, the cards are flipped and you can try again!

Note: If you flip a card a second or more times and no match occurs, you will lose points.
